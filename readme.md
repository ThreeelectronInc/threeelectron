# Threeelectron

A template for 3D desktop applications using Electron. 

The core dependencies included are Three.js, React and Electron.  

A few additional libraries such as Tone.JS are included for demo purposes only.  

Note: The absence of NPM is deliberate.  For now, the goal of this project is that it should only ever require the developer or user to install Electron.

## Requirements (tested with)

### - Ubuntu 16.04, Windows 10 or MacOS High Sierra

### - Electron 2.0.0
