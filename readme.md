# Threeelectron

A minimal setup to get going quickly with Three.js and Electron for 3D desktop applications.

Please note: the absence of NPM is deliberate.  One goal of this project is that it should only ever require the developer or user to install Electron.

## Requirements (tested with)

### - Ubuntu 16.04, Windows 10 or MacOS High Sierra

### - Electron 2.0.0-beta.3
